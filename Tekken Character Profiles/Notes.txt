-Got the idea from a youtube channel where rpg/trading "Cards" display information and have a "zoom in" action when the mouse scrolls over one of the cards.
Also added a "holo" effect that disappears when card is moused over.

-I choose the theme of cards describing characters from my favorite fighting game, Tekken 7.

-Each card contains the name and pre-fight quote of a character, complete with a brief description, their first appearnance in the Tekken franchise, 
character difficulty (does this character have simple moves that are easy to learn, or will a player have to spend several hours practicing before they can 
use said character properly?) and Rank (how viable is this character in a tournament setting; skill needed to use character needed, damage output, etc.)

-Note: Unfortunately, there are few high definition images from the video game Tekken 7 available for free, hence the lack of characters.
