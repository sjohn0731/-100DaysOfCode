# -100DaysOfCode
Completing the Challenge and increasing my skills in Python and JavaScript.


### Day 0: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Spent nearly 3 hours stressing over beginning the Challenge in the first place, then posted a project I'm actually proud of that I completed in one of my Comp. Sci class. Also looked on various sites for ideas and projects to do.

**Thoughts:**: It seems so simple as just getting the studying and the work done. I also need to celebrate small victories; so if I do something such as complete a class on Udemy or FreeCodeCamp, I'll post the final project/certificate/etc.
