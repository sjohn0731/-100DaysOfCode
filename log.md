# -100DaysOfCode
Completing the Challenge and increasing my skills in Python and JavaScript.


### Day 0: January 3, 2020
#####

**Today's Progress**: Spent nearly 3 hours stressing over beginning the Challenge in the first place, then posted a project I'm actually proud of that I completed in one of my Comp. Sci class. Also looked on various sites for ideas and projects to do.

**Thoughts:**: It seems so simple as just getting the studying and the work done. I also need to celebrate small victories; so if I do something such as complete a class on Udemy or FreeCodeCamp, I'll post the final project/certificate/etc.

### Day 1: January 4, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Went back to my FreeCodeCamp account and finished the Basic HTML and HTML5 section. Found several interesting mini projects to build my css skills on a youtube channel (Red Stapler). Worked on 3D RGB Text Animation with HTML/CSS project.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020
**Today's Progress:** No mini projects today, just working on FreeCodeCamp and getting ready for classes to begin this week.


### Day 3: January 6, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Classwork on first day of winter semester took up most of my time, but I was able to get some exercises done from FreeCodeCamp.
I actually finished the Applied Visual Design section of FreeCodeCamp! It doesn't seem like much to me, but my family always tells me to celebrate my small victories.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Today was not the most productive for me, in terms of coding; very little got done today, outside of FreeCodeCamp exercises and browsing project ideas on Youtube and Udemy. I think I need to do at least one mini project a week in a language I'm learning in class (PHP and Python) or languages that I need to practice (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Day 5: January 8, 2020
**Today's Progress:** Spent most of the day attempting to implement PHP and XAMMP on my computer.  There is a project I'm curious about; a social media bot that likes a certain amount of posts from a specific hashtag.  Most social media platforms are pretty strict about bots, so I will keep it small (10 likes or so, if possible). Will also attend a Meetup tomorrow about learning the basics of Angular.js and try a project that will take less than two hours to get working.
