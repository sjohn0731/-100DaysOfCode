# -100DaysOfCode
Completing the Challenge and increasing my skills in Python and JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Spent nearly 3 hours stressing over beginning the Challenge in the first place, then posted a project I'm actually proud of that I completed in one of my Comp. Sci class. Also looked on various sites for ideas and projects to do.

**Thoughts:**: It seems so simple as just getting the studying and the work done. I also need to celebrate small victories; so if I do something such as complete a class on Udemy or FreeCodeCamp, I'll post the final project/certificate/etc.

**Today's Progress:** Went back to my FreeCodeCamp account and finished the Basic HTML and HTML5 section. Found several interesting mini projects to build my css skills on a youtube channel (Red Stapler). Worked on 3D RGB Text Animation with HTML/CSS project.
